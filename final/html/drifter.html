  <h1>You Are a Drifter!</h1>
  <p1>You drifted through time like a casual tourist who somehow ended up in every important moment. You didn't mean to change history, you just thought the past needed more snack breaks and the future needed more hammocks. You don’t break history, you just crash on its metaphorical couch. In the past, you blended in like a tavern regular who may or may not actually work there. In the future, you strolled through advanced civilization like a lost tourist looking for the nearest food court. You’ve seen it all, touched nothing, and somehow managed to not get arrested in any era.</p1>
