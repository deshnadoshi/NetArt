  <h1>You're an Observer!</h1>
  <p1>You're the mysterious figure in the background. Always watching, rarely interfering. History's biggest fan without needing the attention!You’ve mastered the ancient art of doing absolutely nothing, but in a cool, mysterious way. Like a medieval bard with no lute or a future scientist with too many unread reports, you’ve watched history unfold without so much as a "Hey, maybe don’t do that." Your legacy? A perfectly undisturbed timeline… assuming no one noticed you lurking in the background.</p1>
