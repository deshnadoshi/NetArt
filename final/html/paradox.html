  <h1>You Are a Paradox!</h1>
  <p1>You didn't just travel through time, you poked it, laughed at it, and watched it unravel like a bad sweater. Past, present, future? You made it all into a weird soup. But hey, at least it's *your* soup now. You weren’t supposed to tell medieval peasants about electricity or convince future AI to act more human...but you did, and now time is as messed up as a knight in a spacesuit. Past, present, future...who even knows anymore? You certainly don’t, but hey, at least it’s interesting!</p1>
