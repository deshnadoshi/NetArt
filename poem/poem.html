  <p><em>I will love you with no regard to the actions of our enemies or the jealousies of actors. I will love you with no regard to the outrage of certain parents or the boredom of certain friends. I will love you <b>no matter</b> what is served in the worldâ€™s cafeterias or what game is played at each and every recess. I will love you <b>no matter</b> how many fire drills we are all forced to endure, and <b>no matter</b> what is drawn upon the blackboard in a blurring, boring chalk. I will love you <b>no matter</b> how many mistakes I make when trying to reduce fractions, and <b>no matter</b> how difficult it is to memorize the periodic table. I will love you <b>no matter</b> what your locker combination was, or how you decided to spend your time during study hall. I will love you <b>no matter</b> how your soccer team performed in the tournament or how many stains I received on my cheerleading uniform. 
    <p> I will love you if &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I never see you again, and <br> I will love you if &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I see you every Tuesday. <br><br> I will love you if &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you cut your hair and <br> I will love you if &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you cut the hair of others.</p>
    <p> I will love you if &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you abandon your baticeering, and <br> I will love you if &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you retire from the theater to take up some other, less dangerous occupation.</p>
    <p> I will love you if &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you drop your raincoat on the floor instead of hanging it up and <br> I will love you if &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you betray your father.</p>
    <p> I will love you even if &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you announce that the poetry of Edgar Guest is the best in the world and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even if &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you announce that the work of Zilpha Keatley Snyder is unbearably tedious.</p>
    <p>I will love you if &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you abandon the theremin and take up the harmonica and <br> I will love you if &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you donate your marmosets to the zoo and your tree frogs to M.</p>
    <br>I will love you as the starfish loves a coral reef and as kudzu loves trees, even if the oceans turn to sawdust and the trees fall in the forest without anyone around to hear them. <br><br> I will love you as <ol><li>the pesto loves the fetuccini</li> and as <li>the horseradish loves the miyagi,</li> as <li>the tempura loves the ikura</li> and <li>the pepperoni loves the pizza.</li></ol>I will love you as the manatee loves the head of lettuce and as the dark spot loves the leopard, as the leech loves the ankle of a wader and as a corpse loves the beak of the vulture. I will love you as the doctor loves his sickest patient and a lake loves its thirstiest swimmer. 
    <center><h1>I will love you as the beard loves the chin,</h1> <h2>and the crumbs love the beard,</h2> <h3>and the damp napkin loves the crumbs,</h3> <h4>and the precious document loves the dampness in the napkin,</h4> <h5>and the squinting eye of the reader loves the smudged print of the document,</h5> <h6>and the tears of sadness love the squinting eye as it misreads what is written.</h6></center> 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will love you as the iceberg loves the ship, 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the passengers love the lifeboat, 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the lifeboat loves the teeth of the sperm whale, 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the sperm whale loves the flavor of naval uniforms. 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will love you as a child loves to overhear the conversations of its parents, 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the parents love the sound of their own arguing voices, 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as the pen loves to write down the words these voices utter in a notebook for safekeeping. 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will love you as a shingle loves falling off a house on a windy day and striking a grumpy person across the chin, 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as an oven loves malfunctioning in the middle of roasting a turkey. 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will love you as an airplane loves to fall from a clear blue sky 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as an escalator loves to entangle expensive scarves in its mechanisms. 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will love you as a wet paper towel loves to be crumpled into a ball and thrown at a bathroom ceiling 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and an eraser loves to leave dust in the hairdos of the people who talk too much. 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will love you as a taxi loves the muddy splash of a puddle 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as a library loves the patient tick of a clock.
    <p>I will love you as a <ul><li>thief loves a gallery</li> and as a <li>crow loves a murder,</li> as a <li>cloud loves bats</li> and as a <li>range loves braes.</li></ul> </p></em>

    <center><br> <b>I will love you as <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/series/42069-a-series-of-unfortunate-events"> misfortune loves orphans</a>, as fire loves innocence and as justice loves to sit and watch while <h3>everything</h3> <h2>goes</h2> <h1>wrong.</h1></b></center>
