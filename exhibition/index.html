    <h1>404 <del>Not</del> Found!</h1>
    <h2>Curated by Deshna Doshi</h2>
    <p>This exhibition is a curation of various net art projects that all reflect the
        relationship between human beings and the internet that separates them. These works are
        examples of how the internet has begun imitating human experience, bringing anonymity,
        intimacy, and collective memory together through different forms of data collection. Lovelines
        and We Feel Fine by Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar highlight the importance of emotional
        expression, using data found through online blogs to capture the range of human emotions. The
        Unsent Project by Rora Blue also delves into the words left unsaid in modern communication by
        exploring the vulnerability and complexity of unexpressed emotions. These websites all explore
        the depth of human connection in the digital age, creating large repositories of emotional
        experiences that in another time might have remained private or personal. Net art of this type
        almost creates an avenue for emotional release or expression. What was a quiet, personal
        catharsis of love, hate, regret, etc. is now made public, for the world to see. These projects
        emphasize that the nature of the internet is paradoxical. The internet is a space, where despite
        its vastness, people are able to form meaningful connections and express even the most
        obscure human feelings.</p>

    <p>Lovelines (2006) by Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar
        <br>
        Lovelines collects and visualizes anonymous love-related messages posted on the
        internet and presents them in “real-time” to the user on an interactive platform. The website
        interconnects various color-coded lines to represent different emotions and their correlation.

    <p>The Unsent Project (2015) by Rora Blue
        <br>
        The Unsent Project allows people to anonymously share their unsent messages to
        their loved ones, capturing raw and unexpressed human emotions. The website curates these
        personal messages and creates an archive highlighting the vulnerability of human beings.

        <p>We Feel Fine tracks and collects millions of blog posts that contain the words “I
        feel” to create a massive portrait of collective human emotion. The website combines these
        different quotes with images to showcase the disparity in human emotions, ranging from
        humorous to serious.
